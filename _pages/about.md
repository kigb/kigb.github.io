I am 21 years old, interested in 📸photographing, 🎺playing trumpet,🎮playing video games, 🗣️debating, and (maybe) 🏋🏼going to gym.

I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student at **SJTU SE**, and will graduate in 2025. I will soon be starting my Master's program at **CMU SCS LTI** .

I am currently working on Large Language Models in the field of multi-modalities, code generation and prompt engineering. Moreover, I am also interested in Database development and looking forward to learning more about AI infrastructure.

I am willing to be contacted through wechat(fyx_04) or the social media listed!👏🏼
